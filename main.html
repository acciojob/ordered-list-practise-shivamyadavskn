		We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program,
		<br>
		<li>We can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied</li>
		<li>We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase itâ€™s total run time</li>
		<li>We can reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms</li>
